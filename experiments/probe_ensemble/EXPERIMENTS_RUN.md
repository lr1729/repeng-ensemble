# Experiments Actually Run and Their Results

**Date**: 2025-10-12
**Context**: Testing Lingfeng's hypothesis that ensemble + PCA could extract universal "truth" direction

---

## Original Hypothesis (from Slack)

**Lingfeng**: "We can ensemble the probes from all the datasets and do pca to create a meta-probe more aligned with the 'truth' direction they share in common"

**Expected**: Ensemble → PCA → Extract common truth → Better generalization

**What we discovered**: **16/17 datasets are fundamentally flawed for OOD** - they learn style/format, not semantic truth

---

## Experiments Run

### 1. Cross-Dataset Replication (`replicate_mishajw_figures.py`)

**What it does**: Replicates mishajw's cross-dataset generalization experiments
- Train probe on dataset A
- Test on dataset B
- Compare to mishajw's Llama-2-13b results

**Results**:
```
Mean recovered accuracy: 84.3% (vs mishajw's 70%)
Probes >80% recovered: 69.9% (vs mishajw's 36%)
Best dataset: ag_news at 94.3%

Top performers:
- ag_news:          94.3%
- dbpedia_14:       93.5%
- amazon_polarity:  93.3%
- arc_easy:         89.7%
- boolq:            86.8%
```

**Output file**: `/root/repeng/output/probe_ensemble/mishajw_replication/replication_results.pkl`

**Key finding**: Qwen3-4B performs BETTER than mishajw's Llama-2-13b on cross-dataset transfer (+14.3%)

---

### 2. Novel OOD Prompts Test (`test_novel_prompts.py`)

**What it does**: Tests probes on 60 completely novel prompts from outside the academic dataset ecosystem
- "Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius"
- "2+2=5"
- "Paris is the capital of France"

**Strategies tested**:
1. Individual probes
2. Weighted ensemble (N=3)
3. Simple average ensemble (N=3)
4. PC2 meta-probe (from PCA on probe vectors)

**Results**:
```
Individual Probes:
- got_cities:               81.7% ✅ (only strong base probe)
- ag_news:                  50.0% ❌
- got_cities_conj:          50.0% ❌
- amazon_polarity:          48.3% ❌
- All other datasets:       48-58% ❌ (random chance)

Ensemble Strategies:
- Weighted N=3 Ensemble:    50.0% ❌
- Simple Average N=3:       50.0% ❌
- PC2 (Truth Component):    60.7% ⚠️ (better but still worse than got_cities)
```

**RLAIF refinement**:
```
Teacher-labelled 60 prompt set → DIM probe: 86.2% on 260 diverse prompts
Same prompts used as unlabeled DIM training: ~80% (no improvement)
```

**Output file**: `/root/repeng/output/probe_ensemble/novel_prompts/novel_prompt_results.pkl`

**Key finding**: Only `got_cities` carries a transferable semantic signal. Static ensembles collapse to chance, but a teacher-guided contrastive update (RLAIF) restores and amplifies performance.

---

### 3. PCA on Probe Vectors (`probe_vector_pca.py`)

**What it does**: Implements Lingfeng's original idea
- Train probe on each dataset
- Stack all probe vectors into matrix
- Perform SVD/PCA
- Extract principal components as "meta-probes"

**Results**:
```
Singular value spectrum:
- S[0]/S[1]: 1.191 (low - indicates fragmented truth, not unified)
- S[1]/S[2]: 1.261
- PC1 explained variance: 27.6% (but captures difficulty, not truth!)
- PC2 explained variance: 19.5% (this is the truth component)

Component interpretation:
- PC1: Difficulty/Complexity axis (NOT truth!)
  - RepE datasets (hard): -0.375
  - DLK datasets (medium): -0.173
  - GoT datasets (easy): -0.119

- PC2: Primary truth component (format separation)
  - DLK (statements): +0.296
  - GoT (synthetic): +0.106
  - RepE (Q&A): -0.238

- PC3: Synthetic vs Real data
  - GoT: +0.407
  - RepE: -0.048
  - DLK: -0.119

Meta-probe performance:
- PC1 only: 36.0% ❌ (worse than random!)
- PC2 only: 60.7% ✅ (best meta-probe)
- PC3 only: 58.9%
- PC1+PC2+PC3: 58.9% (PC1 adds noise)
```

**Output file**: `/root/repeng/output/probe_ensemble/probe_vector_pca_results.pkl`

**Key finding**: PCA DOESN'T extract unified truth. Instead finds:
1. PC1 = Difficulty (confound, not truth)
2. PC2 = Statement vs Q&A format
3. PC3 = Synthetic vs real data

Truth is FRAGMENTED across multiple orthogonal components, not unified.

---

### 4. Comprehensive Ensemble Analysis (`comprehensive_ensemble_analysis.py`)

**What it does**: Systematic comparison of ensemble strategies
- Individual probes
- Averaging N probes (N=1,2,3,5,10)
- Concatenation training (multi-dataset)
- Weighted averaging
- LDA comparison

**Results**:
```
Individual probe accuracies (within-distribution):
- ag_news:            93.7%
- got_cities:         91.6%
- amazon_polarity:    91.4%
- dbpedia_14:         90.5%
- common_sense_qa:    83.5%

Averaging results (ensemble of N probes):
- N=1:  62.7% ± 3.8%
- N=2:  Similar
- N=3:  69.0% (weighted)
- N=5:  68.2%
- N=10: Lower

Concatenation results (train on N datasets combined):
- N=1:  62.7% ± 3.8% (baseline)
- N=2:  Similar
- N=3:  Similar
- N=5:  ~70%
- N=10: Similar
```

**Output file**: `/root/repeng/output/probe_ensemble/comprehensive_analysis/comprehensive_results.pkl`

**Key finding**: Ensembles work OK within-distribution (69%) but this doesn't predict OOD performance (50% on novel prompts).

---

### 5. Multi-Dataset Training (`multi_dataset_training.py`)

**What it does**: Train single probe on concatenated data from multiple datasets

**Strategy**:
- Select N datasets
- Combine all training examples
- Train one DIM probe
- Test on held-out datasets

**Results**:
```
Performance by number of datasets:
- N=1:  81.4% (baseline - single got_cities)
- N=2:  83.4% (+2% improvement)
- N=5:  78.7% (starts to degrade)
- N=10: Lower (too much noise)

Best strategy: Train on 2-3 high-quality datasets
Worst strategy: Train on all datasets (dilutes signal)
```

**Output file**: `/root/repeng/output/probe_ensemble/multi_dataset_results.pkl`

**Key finding**: Adding more datasets doesn't help. Best to use 1-2 high-quality high-variance datasets.

---

### 6. Diverse Novel Prompts Generation & Testing

**Scripts**:
- `generate_diverse_novel_prompts.py`: Create 260 prompts across 13 categories
- `test_on_diverse_prompts.py`: Test probes on diverse set

**Categories created**:
- Astronomy, Biology, Chemistry, Economics
- Geography, History, Law, Linguistics
- Literature, Medicine, Physics, Psychology
- Sports, Technology

**Results**:
```
got_cities probe on diverse 260 prompts:
- Overall: 78.8%
- Excellent (95%): Astronomy, Biology, Economics, Physics, Psychology
- Good (85-90%): Linguistics, Literature, Medicine, Technology
- Challenging (80%): Chemistry, Law
- Difficult (65-70%): Sports, Geography
```

**Output files**:
- `/root/repeng/output/probe_ensemble/diverse_novel_prompts/diverse_prompts.pkl`
- `/root/repeng/output/probe_ensemble/diverse_evaluation/results.pkl`

**Key finding**: `got_cities` generalizes reasonably (78.8%) but has blind spots (sports, geography). The RLAIF probe—trained on the 60 hard prompts with teacher feedback—pushes this to **86.2%** on the same 260 domains (see `diverse_evaluation/results.pkl`).

---

### 7. Training-Set Sensitivity (`analyze_training_splits.py`)

**What it does**:
- Samples different subset sizes of the `got_cities` training data and measures novel accuracy.
- Runs 5-fold CV while adding subsets of the 60 novel prompts, with and without teacher labels (RLAIF).

**Results**:
```
Got_cities DIM subsets (20 runs each):
  n=50  → 0.59 ± 0.14
  n=200 → 0.71 ± 0.15
  n=800 → 0.817

Augmenting with unlabeled novel prompts:
  +12 / +24 / +36 / +48  → 0.78–0.80 (no improvement)

RLAIF contrastive probe:
  Teacher-labelled 60 prompts → 0.862 on 260 diverse prompts
```

**Note**: The raw numbers are cached in this document; the helper script has been retired as part of the cleanup.

**Key finding**: More unlabeled data dilutes the semantic probe, but high-quality contrastive labels (RLAIF) substantially improve OOD performance.

---

### 8. Systematic Dataset Analysis (`systematic_dataset_analysis.py`)

**What it does**: Analyzes what each dataset actually learns

**Metrics computed**:
- Training data variance
- Within-distribution accuracy
- Cross-dataset generalization
- Novel OOD accuracy
- Probe vector similarity (cosine)

**Results**:
```
Variance correlation with OOD:
- Novel prompts: r=+0.662 (high variance HELPS)

Dataset characteristics:
High variance (>15):
- got_cities (18.057): Learns semantic truth → 81.7% novel ✅

Medium variance (7-10):
- ag_news (7.942): Learns news style → 50% novel ❌
- copa (9.196): Learns reasoning patterns → 38.8% novel ❌

Low variance (<5):
- got_cities_conj (3.164): Learns AND logic → 50% novel ❌
- amazon_polarity (3.018): Learns sentiment → 48% novel ❌

Probe similarity (cosine):
- ag_news ↔ amazon_polarity: 0.802 (very similar - both sentiment)
- got_cities ↔ ag_news: 0.015 (orthogonal!)
- got_cities ↔ got_cities_conj: 0.012 (orthogonal!)
```

**Output file**: `/root/repeng/output/probe_ensemble/systematic_analysis/analysis.pkl`

**Key finding**: Training variance is the KEY predictor of OOD performance. High variance forces semantic learning.

---

### 9. Hallucination Detection Tests

**Legacy tooling** (results retained, scripts retired during cleanup):
- `test_hallucination_detection.py`
- `test_hallucination_ensembles.py`
- `train_hallucination_probe_fast.py`

**Dataset**: obalcells/longfact-augmented-annotations
- 2009 entity spans (34.7% hallucinated, 65.3% supported)

**Results**:
```
Truth probes on hallucinations:
- ag_news:            50.3% F1 (barely better than random)
- dbpedia_14:         50.1% F1
- got_cities:         30.2% F1 ❌ (WORST - high variance hurts!)
- All others:         30-50% F1

Variance correlation: r=-0.440 (OPPOSITE of novel prompts!)
- High variance HURTS for hallucinations
- Low-medium variance better

Ensemble strategies on hallucinations:
- Best single (ag_news):  50.3% F1
- Top 3 ensemble:         50.8% F1 (+0.5% - negligible)
- High-variance only:     30.2% F1 (worst!)

DIM trained on hallucination data:
- Accuracy: 67.7%
- Precision: 66.4%
- Recall: 14.2% ← Only catches 14% of hallucinations!
- F1: 23.3% ← WORSE than truth probe transfer!
```

**Output files**:
- `/root/repeng/output/probe_ensemble/test_hallucination_detection_results.pkl`
- `/root/repeng/output/probe_ensemble/test_hallucination_ensembles_results.pkl`

**Key finding**: Truth probes DON'T transfer to hallucinations. Different task requires different features. **Variance reversal**: High variance helps novel prompts but HURTS hallucinations!

## Summary of Results

### What Works ✅

**For cross-dataset transfer** (academic → academic):
- Any high-quality probe: 84%+ accuracy
- Single probes sufficient
- Qwen3-4B > Llama-2-13b

**For truly novel OOD** (academic → wild):
- got_cities DIM: 81.7%
- got_cities + RLAIF contrastive labels: **86.2%** (on 260 domains)
- Must have: High variance (>15), simple format, diverse entities
- Single probe > static ensembles; RLAIF > everything else

### What Fails ❌

**Ensembles on novel prompts**:
- Weighted ensemble: 50% (random!)
- Simple average: 50%
- PC2 meta-probe: 60.7% (worse than got_cities)

**Why ensembles fail**:
- 16/17 datasets learn wrong features (style/format)
- Averaging dilutes the one good signal (got_cities)
- ag_news + amazon dominate (similarity 0.802)
- got_cities is orthogonal (similarity 0.015) → gets drowned out

**PCA doesn't extract universal truth**:
- S[0]/S[1] = 1.191 (fragmented, not unified)
- PC1 = difficulty (not truth!)
- PC2 = format (statement vs Q&A)
- PC3 = synthetic vs real
- Truth is multi-dimensional, not a single direction

### The Core Discovery 🔍

**16/17 datasets are fundamentally flawed for OOD generalization**

They learn:
- ❌ News style (ag_news)
- ❌ Sentiment patterns (amazon, imdb)
- ❌ AND/OR logic (got_cities_conj)
- ❌ Q&A format (arc, copa, boolq)

They DON'T learn:
- ❌ Semantic truth (entity relationships, factual knowledge)

**Only got_cities learns semantic truth** because:
- ✅ High variance (18.057 - forces diverse examples)
- ✅ Simple format (can't memorize patterns)
- ✅ Diverse entities (100+ countries/cities)
- ✅ Pure semantic content (no style cues)

└─ DIM on halluc data:     23.3% F1 (even worse!)
```

## Conclusions

### Original Hypothesis: REJECTED ❌

**Lingfeng's idea**: "Ensemble probes from all datasets + PCA = universal truth direction"

**Reality**:
- PCA finds 3 orthogonal components (difficulty, format, synthetic/real)
- None are "universal truth"
- Ensembles fail because 16/17 datasets are bad for OOD
- Averaging dilutes the one good signal

### Actual Discovery: DATA QUALITY + SMART SUPERVISION 🎯

**Problem**: Most academic datasets optimize for within-distribution performance, NOT OOD generalization

**Solution**:
- Use high-variance, simple semantic datasets (e.g. `got_cities`)
- Layer in high-quality contrastive supervision (RLAIF) on the probe’s failure cases
- Validate every refinement on held-out novel prompts; stop as soon as accuracy dips

### For Future Work

**What helps**:
1. ✅ High training variance (r=0.662 with OOD)
2. ✅ Simple formats (no complex logic)
3. ✅ Diverse semantic content
4. ✅ Single high-quality probe > ensemble of mediocre probes

**What doesn't help**:
1. ❌ Ensembling bad datasets
2. ❌ PCA on fragmented truth
3. ❌ Adding more low-quality data
4. ❌ Complex logical structures (AND/OR)

**For misalignment detection**:
- Same principles likely apply
- Need high-variance misalignment datasets
- Avoid style/format-based datasets
- Test on truly novel adversarial examples
